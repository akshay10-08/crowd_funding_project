# Crowd Funding Smart Contract

This is a simple Solidity project that demonstrates how crowdfunding can work on the Ethereum blockchain.  
The creator sets a funding goal (in Ether) and a deadline, and people can contribute by sending Ether to the contract.  
All contributions are tracked by address, and once the goal is reached, the creator can withdraw the funds.  
The contract also emits events for contributions and goal completion, making it easy to follow whatâ€™s happening.  

Built with Solidity ^0.8.20 and tested on Remix IDE.  
This is a learning project and can be extended with features like refunds or multiple campaigns.
